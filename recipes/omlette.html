    <p>My husband loves omelettes and nothing makes him happier. When cooking an omelette, it's important that you keep
        your temperature on the low side, as you don't want your omelette to get brown. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk for a few minutes
            until egg mixture is foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so
            bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges with a spatula and
            tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no
            visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line
            in the middle of the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then slide omelette onto
            plate.</li>
    </ol>
